                <h3>How are we different from a traditional university?</h3>
                <p>Instead of asking our students to bet on us, we bet on them first. Lambda’s model is built on Income Share Agreements (ISAs) – our students pay no tuition upfront, and agree to pay back 17% of their income post-graduation for two years, but only once they’re making $50,000 or more.</p>

                <h3>Our paradigm-shifting model proves we're in this together.</h3>
                <p>It allows us to align the incentives of the school with the incentives of our students – and we all win when our graduates succeed. “If we promise someone that our education will help them get a job, and we’re wrong about that, why should we be paid?” -CEO Austen Allred on the Medium.</p>
